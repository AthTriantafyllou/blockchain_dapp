This is an exercide done while I was at university. 
It's purpose was to learn how blockchain transactions worked. 
We created test accounts with ganache and created transactions between them through a webpage.
The main code is in .sol files
It includes all the .js files that we needed to create to run all the actions needed for the crowdfunding campaings.

The main thing that we did with .js is make all the buttons funcionable to do various tasks, like bet, remove bet, etc.

There are some screenshots of the sofware available to see in the repository. By all the other files.
